// Tuple is a type that represents an array with a fixed number of elements,where each element can have a different type.
// The order of thetypes in the tuple definition corresponds to the order of  values in the actual array .
// Tuples are similar to arrays , but they have a specific structure and can be used to model finite sequences with known lengths.

let myTuple : [number,string];
myTuple = [10,"Hello World"];
console.log(myTuple);
